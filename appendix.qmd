# A. Purpose of this Appendix
This appendix provides full transparency on how Large Language Model (LLM) tools were used to support the creation of my **MBA Portfolio Webpage** (Assignment 1).

It explains:

1. Which prompts I used and for what purpose.  
2. Examples of the unedited draft text generated by the model.  
3. How I verified, edited, and personalized the content.  
4. Which sections are entirely my own work.  

The goal is to demonstrate **ethical and responsible AI use** that aligns with University Canada West’s academic-integrity expectations.

# B. Prompts I Used
Below are the main LLM prompts I employed during portfolio development.  
Each prompt served as a brainstorming or drafting aid; all final text and data were verified, rewritten, and fact-checked by me.

### 1. Portfolio Outline and Draft
**Prompt:**  
“Create an outline and sample text for a one-page MBA student portfolio including: About, Education, Professional Experience, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections. Keep the tone concise, formal, and professional, suitable for a business school context.”

**Purpose:**  
To obtain a structural starting point and style guide for the webpage.

### 2. About Section / Personal Bio
**Prompt:**  
“Write a professional ‘About Me’ paragraph for an MBA candidate with a mechanical-engineering background and 10 + years in the heavy-equipment industry. Include focus on leadership, sales operations, project management, and business analytics.”

**Purpose:**  
To generate a first draft of the *About Me* section that I later personalized with verified career details.

### 3. Skills Section (TriMetrix Indigo Integration)
**Prompt:**  
“Using the behavioral insights from my TriMetrix Indigo report, list 15–20 key skills and personal strengths in concise, professional wording. Highlight traits such as decision-making, integrity, diplomacy, problem solving, negotiation, and leadership.”

**Purpose:**  
To translate assessment data into résumé-appropriate language.

### 4. Experience and Achievements
**Prompt:**  
“Convert my work experience into quantitative bullet points emphasizing measurable results such as sales growth, inventory turnover, efficiency improvements, and training initiatives in the construction and mining sectors.”

**Purpose:**  
To obtain impact-based phrasing that I verified and adjusted to real figures from my professional history.

### 5. Quarto / Technical Setup
**Prompt:**  
“Guide me step-by-step to build a Quarto-based MBA portfolio webpage with a navbar linking to Home, CV, and Appendix. Include Bootstrap Icons, responsive layout, a centered headshot, and consistent theme color #0056b3.”

**Purpose:**  
To configure the Quarto environment, metadata (`_quarto.yml`), and HTML structure correctly.

### 6. CV Integration
**Prompt:**  
“Help me create a cv.qmd page that displays my downloadable PDF résumé and an inline preview within the Quarto website. Style it professionally with a ‘Download CV’ button and embedded PDF.”

**Purpose:**  
To make my résumé accessible and stylistically aligned with the site.

### 7. Appendix Composition
**Prompt:**  
“Write an Appendix page for my MBA portfolio documenting how I used an LLM responsibly — including prompts, raw outputs, editing process, and integrity statement — following UCW academic policy.”

**Purpose:**  
To ensure transparency and compliance with the responsible-AI component of the assignment.

# C. Raw LLM Output (Unedited Draft Text)
Below are short samples of unedited text produced by the model before I revised it.  
These show tone and structure but not my final content.

## C1. Original “About Me” Draft

MBA candidate with mechanical-engineering background and over ten years of experience in heavy-equipment sales and service. Passionate about leadership, innovation, and using analytics to drive smarter decisions in industrial operations.

## C2. Original “Skills & Strengths” Draft

• Strategic Decision Making – Able to analyze complex challenges and select the most efficient course of action.  
• Integrity and Responsibility – Dependable professional who delivers on commitments.  
• Diplomacy and Team Collaboration – Builds trust and resolves conflict constructively.  
• Analytical Thinking – Uses data to guide improvement.  
• Continuous Learning – Committed to self-development and process excellence.

## C3. Original “Section Layout Proposal”

1. About  
2. Education  
3. Experience  
4. Projects  
5. Skills  
6. Contact  
(Optional) CV tab and Appendix tab for transparency

# D. How I Edited the AI Output
Once I figure out how to articulate the question to obtain the output from the LLM model that fits my idea for how I want to start the portfolio project, I type two or three times (brainstorming), different instructions until I feel satisfied about the result matching my real skills, attributes, background, and professional experience.

The main editting actions were:

- **Personalization and Context Alignment:**
 Using the idea of how I can describe my personal and professional background, I rewrote and used new words, such as my personality style and my engineering background, to connect my principal statement on how I want to express and sound in my About me text.

 - **Quantitative Verification:**
 I completely rewrote this section, using relevant information and milestones from my professional career (≈ 30 % sales increase, ≈ 4× inventory turnover, ≈ 9.25 % annual growth, ≈ 10 % reduction in dead stock), but the structure of how to present it is the one the model suggests for a smooth visualization.

 - **Tone and Professional Voice:**
 I changed the tone and generic voice to a professional context, aligned with the MBA Portfolio and recruitment context.

 - **TriMetrix Indigo Translation:**
 For a better interpretation of my personal skills and strengths, I used my test to support my personality style, abilities, and competencies *Strategic Decision Making*, *Personal Responsibility*, *Diplomacy and Negotiation*, and *Problem Solving*  
 
 - **Structural Refinement:** 
 I followed the AI's model and order. Still, it underwent many changes, including reformatted and renamed titles, the addition of new sections to showcase professional highlights and projects, and a separate CV for recruitment and an Appendix section for transparency.
 
 - **Technical Formatting in Quarto:**
 One of the changes was Bootstrap Icons, custom color #0056b3, and `.section-card` containers, which provide consistent layout and accessibility.

The changes were based on my professional and personal identity and on my own voice, with a professional tone. Transform AI's suggestion while preserving its benefits, such as an established structure and organization. 

# E. Content Fully Authored by Me
The following elements of the final portfolio were **entirely written, verified, and formatted by me** using factual information from my professional record and academic program.  
These components reflect my authentic experience and original writing.

- **Quantitative and factual content:**  
  All metrics and numerical results in *Professional Highlights* (e.g., ~30 % sales increase, ~4× inventory turnover, ~9.25 % annual growth, ~10 % dead-stock reduction) were calculated and verified by me using real performance data.

- **Project Descriptions:**  
  The three project summaries—*Concrete Pipes Market Expansion (China 2019)*, *Financial Analysis Lubricants Distributors*, and *Truck Mounted Pumps – Turret Retrofit*—were written directly from my professional experience and adapted for academic presentation.

- **Curriculum Vitae (CV):**  
  The entire content of `MiguelCastroCV.pdf`, including education, experience, responsibilities, and measurable results, was authored by me prior to web integration.

- **TriMetrix Indigo Interpretation:**  
  While the LLM suggested professional phrasing, the interpretation, selection, and contextual explanation of my behavioral and driver results were my own work based on my assessment report.

- **Portfolio Design & Quarto Implementation:**  
  I manually configured all technical files (`_quarto.yml`, `index.qmd`, `cv.qmd`, `appendix.qmd`), created folder structures, managed the image directory, selected the *cosmo* theme, and adjusted Bootstrap Icon integration, color palette #0056b3, and layout consistency.

- **Academic Reflection:**  
  All commentary in Section D (“How I Edited the AI Output”) and this Section E was independently written in my own voice to describe editing decisions and ethical practice.

These elements demonstrate complete authorship, factual accuracy, and alignment with University Canada West standards for integrity and responsible AI use.
