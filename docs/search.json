Nevertheless, my expectations for LLMs’ performance and reliability are too high, given the presence of bias during the process, which impacts the output, and the weaker areas where the models struggle, such as ethics or health themes. Now, my perspective is different and serves to return to human thinking and to use the models as tools, not as a principal source that replaces humans. Additionally, the transition from a single-page to a multipage project poses the challenge of integrating various files, connecting them, and providing a design to improve visualization.\nUnderstanding how to give instructions or feed the model with the most accurate inputs to obtain the best outputs, while avoiding bias during the process, is crucial. However, the brainstorming and suggestions provided by the models help refine ideas, clarify concepts, and create better, more structured sections, while optimizing time and speed. Furthermore, maintaining my own voice gives each section of the project an original, self tone. It reflects my personality in each rewrite draft, where the essential facts are decided by me and not for the model, giving a special personalization to my experiences, such as work roles, project achievements, skills, and certifications.\nUsing multiple models allows me to test which is more concise, structured, and accurate in its responses, and which has the best AI behavior, tone, and level of expertise for my project development. Moreover, understanding the importance of the prompt message, the user message, and their relationship helps me know how modern AI in LLMs works.\nThroughout all phases of the project (single- and multipage portfolio), the main reflection is on not relying on or delegating everything to the LLMs without a sense of responsibility, critical thinking, and human judgment. Likewise, the necessity of balancing and achieving joint optimization in which the system performance requires both people and technology, allows social and technical systems optimization.
